Around the end of last year I started writing this blog. Recently I been struggling while trying to find ideas to write about or even the inspiration to do it. And then I suddenly realized that I wasn't even reading anything.

You can't write anything new if you don't read anything new.

As a creator, you need to consume a lot of the type of content you want to create. Inspiration won't strike you out of nowhere, you need to look for it.

## Be honest to yourself and do what you enjoy the most

I've been spending a lot of my free time watching Youtube videos and not reading at all. I couldn't help but wonder if what I really wanted to do was to make videos. 

The answer was no. 

A blog post is a format where I can express myself with total freedom and doesn't necessary take you a lot of time like editing videos. I love editing videos, but right now I just need a quick way of escaping my day job and expressing myself.

In that moment I was honest to myself and recognize what I wanted to do. I Immediately yelled at myself:

"...Then stop watching so many damn videos and **start reading more**"

## Follow amazing creators that do what you want to do

You should at least follow a few people who inspire you to create, otherwise your social networks won't really help you achieve your goals.

One of my favorite authors [Austin Kleon](https://twitter.com/austinkleon) have written about  "Showing your work" . He talks about how artists should share a little bit of their process every day. When you follow people that do this, you're inevitable surrounded by an infinite amount of inspiration.

Let's be honest, now a days we spend an important amount of time on social media.

If we dedicate some time to curate the kind of content that we want to see, with the clear goal of getting as much inspiration as we can, that's a huge step into becoming a prolific creator.

## The process is the reward 

At the very beginning, when we start out as content creators we have no audience but ourselves. You must become the first fan of your content.

That's why you should strive to create something that reflects your values, something that make you feel proud. The process of doing something like that is one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt.

Be aware of what you enjoy watching, reading and/or listening to. Would you like to do something like that? You can!

If you create something that you love consuming, you will improve rapidly and your content will be amazing.
