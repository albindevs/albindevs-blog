We can send and receive narrative elements in an interactive way to tell any kind of story or concept. The presentation of the information can be define in any way, shape or form that enhence the narrative process.

Today time slipped through my fingers like sand, in the best way possible. It all started with taking a look of the Spotify API documentation and having a realization about a kind of content I could produce.

Normally information travels through the internet in json format. Api Documentations present their responses this way, but it's kind of hard to see the full potential of just pairs of keys and values. 

We as developers have the required skills to present those results in any way we want and also give the users the opportunity to perform operations with that information.

Either by guiding the user through a defined narrative or letting them create new ones themselves with the elements we provide, the possibilities are endless.
