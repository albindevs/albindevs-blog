This is a peak to what I did today represented in a handwritten mind map. Drawing things and connections manually made me realize the full power of mapping your thoughts. Most of the things that show in this map are described with detail down below. 

A guide for my day that doesn't have any sort of limitation when it comes to visual elements and creativity. What's in here is my raw thought process and simple drawings that illustrate it very nicely. 

Me expression skill are improving rapidly as each day goes by and the results surprise every single day. I'm displaying the way I see the world and It looks fantastic.
