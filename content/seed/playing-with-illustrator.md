Today I got back illustrator and let me tell you something... It felt goood. I just added a rounded-corner screenshot with a nice looking shadow and a Montserrat title. The simplicity and elegance of just 2 visual elements made the future of my Instagram account bright like a super nova.

I barely watch passive content, I was just in the flow state instantly working on my projects and coming up with new ideas like never before. Battle station working just smoothly and allowing me to explore fueled by inspiration.

**Markdown**... Oh my goodness. Today I had a peek at the infinite possibilities of `.Content` for creating literally any type of web content my imagination can come up with. Combining the power of markdown with the notion exports provides my with a high speed highway of articles for posting.

I have come to a place where it's the process itself what brings me joy. Where all I think about is playing like a child and recording all those events and just sharing with people how I do things. I have discovered within myself the soul of a [content creator](https://albindevs.netlify.app/seed/elements-of-a-narrative/)

I can't believe how much I enjoy experimenting with Illustrator after I thought I had to give up on it. The text, the colors and the shadows It's all too easy.

Basically I select an artist and plan on queuing some of their content and then just have fun with rating them. With a little bit of creativity (and stealing like an artist) the result can look like this. I got the inspiration from my ruler cm measures üìê üòÇ
