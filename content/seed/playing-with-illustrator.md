I can't believe how much I enjoy experimenting with Illustrator after I thought I had to give up on it. The text, the colors and the shadows It's all too easy.

Basically I select an artist and plan on queuing some of their content and then just have fun with rating them. With a little bit of creativity (and stealing like an artist) the result can look like this. I got the inspiration from my ruler cm measures 📐 😂
