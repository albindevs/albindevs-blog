The easiest way to ignite the spark of an interesting activity/problem is to select any subject/noun and come up with as many open ended questions about it as you can.

Let's take Writing as an example:

- How to write better sentences?
- What is narrative?
- How to define a good structure?

I have just came up with those questions. If I perform a research to try to get answers to those questions, I would become a better writer.
