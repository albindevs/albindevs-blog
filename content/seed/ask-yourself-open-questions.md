## 🔍 Look for subjects

Acording to google, a subject is a person or thing that is being discussed, described, or dealt with. Basically anything that you can identify. Any subject has properties, which can be subjects themselfs.

## ⁉️ Your curiosity speaks Wh- questions

Ask yourself wh questions about any subject that interest you, that's how you gain tons of new knowledge and produce lots of new ideas for more explorations.

Let's do an example:

**Idea:** An idea is the most inportant unit of knowledge. First wh question:

🧐 What the fuck is an **idea?**

> A thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action.

🤷🏾‍♂️ How do you think of **good** Ideas?

Some tricks by [Inc.com](https://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/7-ways-to-generate-great-ideas.html):

* Engage in observation
* Read more books
* Ramdomly surf the web( My personal favorite)
* Keep a regular journal
* Meditate (I love this one)

Every one of these tricks can be a seed itself. And it all started because of a good wh qustion about the subject: **Idea**

The easiest way to ignite the spark of an interesting activity/problem is to select any subject/noun and come up with as many open ended questions about it as you can.

Let's take **Writing** as an example:

* How to write better sentences?
* What is narrative?
* How to define a good structure?

I have just came up with those questions. If I perform a research to try to get answers to those questions, I would become a better writer.
