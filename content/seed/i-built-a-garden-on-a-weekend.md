This week my stress levels reached their all-time high for almost 72 hours straight. I could barely sleep. What I do for a living and also for fun( which is the point in this note, more on that later) turned out to feel like a nightmare all of a sudden.

Overwhelmed by the amount of details that my bosses kept telling me to fix, I managed myself to stay on track and finally [deliver](http://syspedidos.dev.sysmodelers.com/diet-generator/). It was unpleasant but also an experience where I gained a significant amount of real world experience.

Here's the funny part. I would have think that after those events I wouldn't want to see a single line of code during this weekend. I couldn't be more wrong.

By this point, my mind was totally over driving to exponential grow. I had set some tasks for myself before work week began. I open up my notion and It all start rolling intermediately. Feeling like a fish in the water I start to dive deep into [digital gardens](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/).

I literally could not finish the first article of the queue I had prepare. Just by reading the first definition of this exciting new world of gardens I was mesmerized. 

I couldn't help myself but open up my text editor and start composing my own lines of code to build something of my own. Only two or three paragraphs of that article motivated my to build [my garden](https://albindevs.netlify.app/seed/) intermediately. 

It was far from being a straightforward process. I wast not happy at all with the initial results. That night, the thoughts of improvements for the gardens kept rounding and rounding my head, depriving me from getting back to sleep.

I even started to worry about my self. It was shocking to me realizing how invested I am with my projects and ideas. What I know for sure is that I'm doing something that I love.

I was tired of rolling in my bed. So I woke up early and started coding those improvements right away. Those up there are the results. I was finally satisfied with what I had developed.

It looks nice and more importantly it is practical. The biggest improvement I came up with was the beautiful threat button. It symbolizes that I can keep developing any note and takes me their exact position on my notion to add, cut, edit, and improve more my thoughts. Awesome.

My digital garden It's finally alive and looking how I like. One of my most important weekend projects ever. It's funny that now that I'm no longer unemployed, weekend projects take a whole new meaning. Much more valuable.
