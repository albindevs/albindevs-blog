This seed is directly inspired by one of the most useful books I will ever read and reread in my life[: Show Your Work!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work)

I will be describing my ideas on what it means to share the things you do with the entire world and get discovered.

## üìó¬†Reading comes before writing

Love reading at least twice as much as you love writing. Your desire to be a writer and creator will never be authentic if you don't feel delighted by the works of others.

Writing is by definition an extension of your passion for reading. It's because you read that your mind is filled with words that you can later on in building block for you own stories.

## üëÅÔ∏è Interact with other people's work

Become a fan of people who share creative things. If you want to be noticed, you have to notice. If you want to be **interesting**, you have to be **interested**. Curiosity is the soul of interesting people. [Explore by questioning](https://www.notion.so/Explore-by-questioning-48d34f293d084c25a33d97bc8d51ae25)

## üèë Find the starting point

Sharing the way you think and how you do things is your most valuable product. As author Austin Kleon says in his book, "Think process, not product". Export your process.

Defining how to share a process might be complex. That's why finding the starting point where anybody can begin is key. It validates a good idea for posting.

Put yourself in the shoes of someone who's trying to do it for the first time and knows nothing about it.
