                    <li>What do I want?</li>
                    <li>Why do I want it?</li>

                <p>First one is super easy, second one is tricky depending on your self-awareness and your values. Actually executing the
                    third one can be as easy as sewing your own parachute while free falling from 10 thousand feet. But you know, at least a
                    bad plan is better than no plan, right?.</p>
